# binning-get-started

This repository contains the notebook `binning-get-started.ipynb` which showcases the CloudDrift's binning module. This notebook should be readily executable in a binder environment which can be launched by clicking the "launch binder" badge above ☝️. Alternatively, you can run the notebook in a python environment containing the python libraries listed in the file `pyproject.toml`. With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on your system, this can be done using `uv sync`.

Feel free to reach out to Philippe Miron with questions and suggestions.
